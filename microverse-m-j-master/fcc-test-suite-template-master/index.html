    <h3 id="headline"> Here's 10 top songs: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10. “Missing My Baby”
          <p>When Selena began to make records in English, she found a fan base that had long yearned for her music but wasn’t able to get past the language barrier. One of the songs that English-language fans ate up was “Missing My Baby,” a beautiful track that capture’s Selena’s soulful tenor at its very best.</p>
        </li>
          9. “Que Creias”
          <p>Though she sadly departed with a hit English album, her best work was in her native tongue, and if you can translate the lyrics, you will find that “Que Creias” is one of her best singles. “Que Crieias” has that Tejano flavor that is so evident in many of her earlier hits, and it is this flavor that really shines on this track.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          8. “Differentes”
          <p>Selena was simply a beautiful singer with deep Texas and Tejano roots. Even when she began to make English albums, Selena stayed true to her roots, which is why songs like “Diffferentes” has a flavor and sincerity that just isn’t found in many Latin recordings.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          7. “Yo Fui Aquella”
          <p>Back in her early days, Selena mixed pop with Tejano, and though there were some that came off as a tad awkward, most of these songs landed. “Yo Fui Aquella” was one of those songs that landed, as the sound is festive and will have you up and dancing. It’s the perfect pick-me-up song and one that should be in your playlist.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          6. “Amame”
          <p>On “Amame,” Selena strays from her Tejano rooted sound and ventures into dance pop, and though it had the potential to be disastrous, “Amame” turned out to be a solid cut that deserves to be among her best recordings.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          5. “Disco Medley”
          <p>Selena perfectly demonstrated on “Disco Medley” that she could do it all. Not only could she dominate English pop and Tejano, but she could cut a mean disco tune as well, and her rendition of “Disco Medley” is one of the best ever made, hands down.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          4. “Don’t Throw Away My Love”
          <p>Selena was fast becoming one of pop’s biggest stars before her death. It puzzles the minds of music purist and critics such as this author as to just how big Selena could have become if her life wasn’t taken so soon. Thankfully, we got a glimpse of what could have been with “Don’t Throw Away My Love,” a dance pop track that is intoxicating to the ears.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          3. “No Quiero Saber”
          <p>Selena’s music was always fun and lively. Not only was her soft and girlish voice was a golden attraction, but her bubbly personality played a huge role in creating her legend, and nowhere was this on great display than on “No Quiero Saber,” a track that, if you’re having a tough day, will instantly make things brighter with her voice and personality.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          2. “Always Mine”
          <p>When Selena began to venture into making English records to crossover, she tailored her sound away from the Tejano that had been a hallmark of her Spanish releases and gravitated to dance pop. It worked, especially on singles like the bubbly and danceable “Always Mine,” because of Selena’s lively personality. As she demonstrated on this track, her fun nature was a natural fit for dance pop, which is why, if she was still alive, she could have easily joined the likes of Madonna as being one of pop’s biggest names.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          1. “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom”
          <p>A lot of people will remember “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom” from the autobiographic movie that depicted her life. Though it’s kind of a shame that this single (for English fans at least) overshadowed the rest of her great catalog, “Bid Bidi Bom Bom” is at the same time a perfect representation of the artist that Selena was, and it’s almost like this track was her lasting gift to all who greatly appreciated her music, and that is why this track is the best in Selena’s short, but storied history.</p>
